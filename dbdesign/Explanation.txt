I think we don't need database like MySQL, MsSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle or some else etc.
Because our project haven't any authentication form, this game is just need to save
singleplayer mode's players highscore. And if we use database server in this project,
players must install database server too. It's not good idea.
But game should save our players names, scores, status. So we decide to save players
score in file like TXT, XML, YML or else.
Is it okey? Teacher?
